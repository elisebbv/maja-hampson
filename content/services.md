### Manuscript Consultations
A manuscript consultation provides you with a high-level overview of how to strengthen and improve your story. This is a great budget option for authors who just need a little direction with where to start, or where to go next and aren't ready for a full developmental edit yet (or can't afford to pay for one).

Includes:
- A complimentary 15-minute introduction meeting 
- An Editorial Letter from me, highlighting big-picture feedback about the overall plot, characters, pacing, and any key areas to focus on strengthening.
