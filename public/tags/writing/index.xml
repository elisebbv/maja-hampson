      <description>Fall 2023 and Winter 2024 have gone down in history. In the last eight months, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to finish drafting and revising a 107,000 word fantasy novel; designed, printed, and celebrated the launch of a literary magazine of student art; and signed at least two new freelance contracts with hopes for at least one or two more for Summer 2024.
Feast your eyes&amp;hellip; üëÄ
  I thought going on hiatus from freelance contracts was going to eviscerate the tenuous career I began building for myself in 2019.</description>

      <title>Why Soft Magic Systems Are So Hard to Write ü™Ñ</title>

      <description>It took me two attempts to finish reading For the Throne by Hannah Whitten. At first, I thought I was just bored because the book started off with different POV characters. But in the end, the thing that was really bothering me was the magic system.
Soft and hard magic systems are like the difference between Star Wars and Project Hail Mary. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite space opera is pretty approachable even if you don&amp;rsquo;t care a lick about science, while Project Hail Mary, from the author of The Martian, will only appeal to those who are willing to learn about the nitty gritty details of the science at play.</description>

      <description>The Nymph Keepers is over.
Does that ever feel good to say! But I think it&amp;rsquo;s also a challenge, to move on from a project that big and fill that space with something new. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong; I haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped writing other drafts and working other stories, so there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of projects. But this is a bit of a goodbye ‚Äî a transition from one season into another, or from one focus toward something new.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Launch Day Maybe you have no trouble believing this, but I&amp;rsquo;m still in a bit of a daze: Queen of the Nymphs is here! Today is the day and Book III of the Nymph Keepers is ready and waiting for you. You can find out how the story ends wherever ebooks are sold.
But wait!
I Made You a Treat Because I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough to do, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d treat you to something a little extra special: Chapters 1 &amp;amp; 2 of Queen of the Nymphs, read by yours truly.</description>

      <description>An Enchantment of Ravens
If We Were Villains
The Love Hypothesis
To Read or Not To Read I can count on one hand the number of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year that have made me want to write. And I&amp;rsquo;ve read 30 books so far. Maybe those aren&amp;rsquo;t great odds. Maybe I should be more selective about the books I pick up; maybe I should DNF (did-not-finish) more often. But once I start reading something, I have an excruciatingly hard time stopping until I reach &amp;ldquo;The End.</description>

      <title>Types of Editing</title>

      <description>Where to Start Editing has many facets, but it tends to be narrowed down to just one: rules. Grammar, punctuation, typos ‚Äî it‚Äôs the first thing we look for when someone asks us to read through the tricky email, announcement, or advertisement they‚Äôre writing. Rules are straightforward. They present a clear right and wrong, and as long as you abide by them, you should be fine. Right?
The problem with language, and English is just as bad for this as any other language, is that the rules are never simple.</description>
