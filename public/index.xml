      <title>Fine Arts Hasn&#39;t Killed Me Yet 👀</title>

      <description>Fall 2023 and Winter 2024 have gone down in history. In the last eight months, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to finish drafting and revising a 107,000 word fantasy novel; designed, printed, and celebrated the launch of a literary magazine of student art; and signed at least two new freelance contracts with hopes for at least one or two more for Summer 2024.
Feast your eyes&amp;hellip; 👀
  I thought going on hiatus from freelance contracts was going to eviscerate the tenuous career I began building for myself in 2019.</description>

      <title>What Spines Ya Crackin&#39;? 📚 (BOOK spines, that is)</title>

      <description>Book spines! I swear I meant BOOK spines! I get that I&amp;rsquo;m a fantasy author with a penchant for the darker tales (though you cannot accuse me of publishing any tragedies, those will never see beyond the deep, dark reaches of a digital filing cabinet). But come ON.
It&amp;rsquo;s now 2024. The last time I updated anyone on my reading progress was last year, when I had read 26 books in the first quarter of 2023.</description>

      <title>The Editor Is on Hiatus! 💜</title>

      <description>I won&amp;rsquo;t be taking on new clients for the foreseeable future because &amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m back in school! Didn&amp;rsquo;t see that coming (said no one, literally ever).
When I told my husband I was done with school for &amp;ldquo;a good while&amp;rdquo; after I finished my editing certificate in 2022, he laughed at me. I defended myself. I&amp;rsquo;d been in school for the past 6 years with no break and only a couple certificates to show for it.</description>

      <title>Editing Reflections: Slowing Down &amp; Catching Up 📚</title>
      <link>https://elisevolkman.com/posts/editing-reflections-q2/</link>

      <description>Freelancing seasons cycle between feast or famine so quickly, it can be disorienting to try and look back at what the past few months have held. On the rollercoaster of &amp;ldquo;How much work do I have this month?&amp;rdquo; I went from slowing down at the end of March to busy enough to make my head spin from April to May. And then by June, things were winding down again. The forecast for July looks dry as well, and then promise of showers for August.</description>

      <title>Why Soft Magic Systems Are So Hard to Write 🪄</title>
      <link>https://elisevolkman.com/posts/hard-and-soft-magic-systems/</link>

      <description>It took me two attempts to finish reading For the Throne by Hannah Whitten. At first, I thought I was just bored because the book started off with different POV characters. But in the end, the thing that was really bothering me was the magic system.
Soft and hard magic systems are like the difference between Star Wars and Project Hail Mary. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite space opera is pretty approachable even if you don&amp;rsquo;t care a lick about science, while Project Hail Mary, from the author of The Martian, will only appeal to those who are willing to learn about the nitty gritty details of the science at play.</description>

      <title>Meet My New Favourite Author, Plus a Few More 📚</title>

      <description>Crows, security robots, seas made of spores, and a subspecies of dragon called a quigutl. Yes, dear friends. You&amp;rsquo;re in for a whole lot of good this quarter. If you need any reading material, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you going for a while. My goal was to read 24 books by the end of this year — that&amp;rsquo;s one each month, in case you hate math as much as I do. Reason being, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t feeling like reading much at all for a while and didn&amp;rsquo;t think I could manage much more than that.</description>

      <title>A Few More Good Reads: Happy New Year! 🥂</title>

      <description>As I sat down to pick out my top reads of the last quarter of 2022, I looked at my list and thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;Well, this looks a lot more like me.&amp;rdquo; And yet, as I write this, I feel less like myself than I ever have. Aren&amp;rsquo;t people funny paradoxes? Funny isn&amp;rsquo;t the right word, but we use it like that all the time. Funny can mean can mean odd, unsettling, and uncomfortable.</description>

      <title>Unexpectedly Expected: 2022 Editing Update</title>

      <description>Life really does not go the way we expect it to sometimes, does it?
We like to say that a lot. We acknowledge the unexpected as a natural part of life and like to make it sound like we&amp;rsquo;re all aware of how uncertain things can be. But then, when something inevitably doesn&amp;rsquo;t go our way, PANIC! at the Disco.
If you asked me today, I would probably say that life is not going my way most of the time.</description>

      <description>Skip to the books
Slowing Down But Never Stopping In August, I popped in here to talk about &amp;ldquo;good writing.&amp;rdquo; By that, I meant the three books I had read that year that made me say &amp;ldquo;I want to write like that one day.&amp;rdquo; (That&amp;rsquo;s the author&amp;rsquo;s version of &amp;ldquo;I want to be like them when I grow up.&amp;quot;) Since then, I have read eight books. Is that a lot? Eight books in two months?</description>

      <description>The Nymph Keepers is over.
Does that ever feel good to say! But I think it&amp;rsquo;s also a challenge, to move on from a project that big and fill that space with something new. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong; I haven&amp;rsquo;t stopped writing other drafts and working other stories, so there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of projects. But this is a bit of a goodbye — a transition from one season into another, or from one focus toward something new.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s Launch Day Maybe you have no trouble believing this, but I&amp;rsquo;m still in a bit of a daze: Queen of the Nymphs is here! Today is the day and Book III of the Nymph Keepers is ready and waiting for you. You can find out how the story ends wherever ebooks are sold.
But wait!
I Made You a Treat Because I don&amp;rsquo;t have enough to do, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d treat you to something a little extra special: Chapters 1 &amp;amp; 2 of Queen of the Nymphs, read by yours truly.</description>

      <description>An Enchantment of Ravens
If We Were Villains
The Love Hypothesis
To Read or Not To Read I can count on one hand the number of books I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year that have made me want to write. And I&amp;rsquo;ve read 30 books so far. Maybe those aren&amp;rsquo;t great odds. Maybe I should be more selective about the books I pick up; maybe I should DNF (did-not-finish) more often. But once I start reading something, I have an excruciatingly hard time stopping until I reach &amp;ldquo;The End.</description>

      <description>SPOILERS FOR HEART OF THE FOREST AHEAD At the start of Heart of the Forest: Book II of the Nymph Keepers, the war between Ireece and Galia has just begun, sparked by the death of the ambassador — the Nymph Keeper — who Jay killed. Meanwhile, a new plot unravels in Fethens, threatening to unravel Forest’s life as court herbalist: Silic and Protis secretly poison the king of Ireece with Hellfire in a zealous attempt to put Terryn on the throne.</description>

      <description>SPOILERS FOR ROOTS OF BLOOD AHEAD After Jay saves Forest from the Butcher — the Nymph Keeper he had originally been working for in order to get the nymph blood he needed to help his sister — he takes her to his home city of Fethens. Forest expected this to be just another stop in a life of horrors. She tries to escape to the mountains, where she finds the rumoured mountain nymphs and hopes for refuge, but as a forest nymph, she cannot survive underground.</description>

      <description>Releasing August 12th… In the final book of The Nymph Keepers, Forest struggles with her duties as court herbalist and the expectations of a future queen as the rot ravaging Galia’s lands creeps over the borders into the other provinces.

      <title>Types of Editing</title>
      <link>https://elisevolkman.com/posts/types-of-editing/</link>

      <description>Where to Start Editing has many facets, but it tends to be narrowed down to just one: rules. Grammar, punctuation, typos — it’s the first thing we look for when someone asks us to read through the tricky email, announcement, or advertisement they’re writing. Rules are straightforward. They present a clear right and wrong, and as long as you abide by them, you should be fine. Right?
The problem with language, and English is just as bad for this as any other language, is that the rules are never simple.</description>

      <description>Nym is the last living nymph in the province of Galia, and Jay is out for her blood.
      I write fantasy and science fiction and have a flair for gothic drama. The Nymph Keepers trilogy is my debut ebook series about Forest, a nymph whose people have been hunted to near-extinction for the healing properties in their blood. Jay needs nymph blood to help his sister, and Forest is supposed to be his solution to everything.</description>

      <description>I love books and helping people. I&amp;rsquo;ll do whatever I can to make sure those worlds collide as often as possible.
   The Backstory People have always told me, “You’re mature for your age,” and “You’re an old soul.” Both very kind, empathetic ways of saying things like “What a dork!” or “You’re such a nerd!” Thanks in part to those kind, empathetic words and people, I’ve come to embrace my old soul (hence The Tea Grannies podcast and my frequent self-imposed use of the term “hermit”).</description>
