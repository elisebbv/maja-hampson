      <description>Miraya Engelage and Elise Volkman bring you writing, editing, and reading tips from the tea-tables of their living rooms. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re an experienced author or new writer, pour yourself a cup of tea and join them for discussions on first drafts, querying, and everything in between.
   Miraya and I met in 2018 when we both apparated into the Speculative Fiction cohort under the guidance of Eileen Cook.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m on hiatus from editing projects while I head back to school to complete my degree. Thanks for understanding üíú I offer manuscript consultations for the exploring author and in-depth editing services for authors with specific goals for their manuscript. That means everything from developmental editing and copy editing down to the nitty gritty of a proofread.
I enjoy a variety of speculative fiction genres, including fantasy, science-fiction, dystopian, gothic, and contemporary, and I like everything from middle grade up to and including adult.</description>

      <description>Nym is the last living nymph in the province of Galia, and Jay is out for her blood.
      I write fantasy and science fiction and have a flair for gothic drama. The Nymph Keepers trilogy is my debut ebook series about Forest, a nymph whose people have been hunted to near-extinction for the healing properties in their blood. Jay needs nymph blood to help his sister, and Forest is supposed to be his solution to everything.</description>
